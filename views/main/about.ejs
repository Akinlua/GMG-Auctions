                        <li>Once approved, a Â£25 fee is charged and your item is scheduled for auction in our WhatsApp group.</li>
                        <li>We will also place a hold on your credit card for Â£195. This payment will only be charged if your watch hits reserve.</li>
                        <li>If your watch hits reserve, you have officially sold it. Congratulations ðŸ¥‚.</li>
                        <li>The next step is to deliver the watch to one of our 4 service centres within the uk. Once delivered, your watch will be verified and you will receive your reserve amount immediately into your bank account.</li>
